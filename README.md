# FINAL_PROJECT_CS110
Experience our maze, a game which will challenge your intelligence. Undergo this immersive experience as you are surrounded by engaging visuals and audios, where the goal is to help the cat grab all cookies and solve the maze, while the enemies chase her. You will have the ability to choose the level you want to play, and you determination will tell how far you go in the game. 
For making this game, engaging and interesting, we modified our three levels in the following way:
1) Easy level- Simply get a taste of what the maze will be like, where you are not surrounded by enemies. You need to grab all the cookies in time and reach the door to win.
2) Medium level- This level introduces enemies, which are spread through out the randomly generated maze, who are programmed to get closer to the player and the door. So remember- faster finger first!
3) Hard level- We have used A* through which the enemies know exactlty where you are. However, if you get to the pickaxes first, you can win the game!

So, what are you waiting for?
